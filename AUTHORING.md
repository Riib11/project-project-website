# Writing posts for the Project Project website

Posts on the Project Project website are generated by [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files. Markdown files are plain text files with extra markup. They're similar to LaTeX files, except they generate HTML instead of PDFs. Markdown is also much simpler than LaTeX.

To learn the basics of writing Markdown, such as writing text with **bold** or _italic_ formatting or including links, see [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example).

To write inline math such as $$f(x) = x$$, quote the approriate latex string with double-dollar signs like so:

```
$$f(x) = x$$ is my favorite formula.
```

You can also write display math such as

$$
\int_0^\infty f(x) dx
$$

by using surrounding the `$$` signs with blank lines, like so:

```
My second favorite formula is 

$$
\int_0^\infty f(x) dx
$$

because I love to practice writing integral signs.
```

To include images in a post, use a [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) include tag:

```
{% raw %}{% include image name="my-image-file.jpg" width="300px" height="400px" caption="A caption for the image." %}{% endraw %}
```

The `width`, `height`, and `caption` arguments are all optional. To include a 3D object, use the `stl` include:

```
{% raw %}{% include stl name="some-3d-object.stl" %}{% endraw %}
```

Any images, STL files, or other assets associated with a post should be stored in the folder:

```
/assets/posts/<post slug>/
```

For example, a post `/_posts/2017-02-03-some-post-name.md` has assets stored in the folder `/assets/posts/some-post-name`.


## Example posts

Have a look at [this markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chnn/project-project-website/master/_posts/2017-07-14-greens-theorem.md) which generates [this post](http://people.reed.edu/~ormsbyk/projectproject/posts/greens-theorem.html).

If you'd like to preview your post as you write it, talk to Chris. He can set you up with a local version of the site that updates as you write.
