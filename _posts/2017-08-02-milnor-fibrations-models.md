This article will talk exclusively about the modelling choices and results.

“Thickened Fiber” is good for any type of fibration.

“Infilled Fiber” is good for any type of fibration, and is especially good for high n,m values for it automatically adjusts for thickness, and also maintains visibility into the singularity-area.

“Fiber Pair” is very good for low n,m values, however it can lose some mathematical significance because you cannot easily distinguish between the fibers that are paired.

“Fiber Pair with imbedded knot” solves the above issue with distinguishing between the fibers, as well as displaying the knot, however it is slightly less aesthetic.

“Asymmetrical Fiber Pair” demonstrates the nature of how the fibers wrap around the knot a little better than just the opposite fibers.

“Cut Knot” is great for low n,m values.

“Cut Knot with imbedded knot” is really cool, but will probably only work for 2,3 and below.
