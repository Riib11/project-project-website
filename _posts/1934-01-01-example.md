This post is generated a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) file. Markdown files are plain text files with extra markup that compile to HTML. To learn the basics of writing Markdown, such as writing text with **bold** or _italic_ formatting or including links, see [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example).

To write inline math such as $$f(x) = x$$, quote the approriate latex string with double-dollar signs like so:

```
$$f(x) = x$$ is my favorite formula.
```

You can also write display math such as

$$
\int_0^\infty f(x) dx
$$

by using surrounding the `$$` signs with blank lines, like so:

```
My second favorite formula is 

$$
\int_0^\infty f(x) dx
$$

because I love to practice writing integral signs.
```

Images for a post are stored in the folder

```
/assets/images/posts/<post date>-<post name>/
```

For example, a post published on 7th July 2017 with the title "Some Post Name" has images stored in the folder

```
/assets/images/2017-07-13-some-post-name/
```

To include images in a post, place the images in the appropriate post image folder and use a [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) include tag:

```
{% raw %}
{% include image name="my-image-file.jpg" width="300px" height="400px" caption="A caption for the image." %}
{% endraw %}
```

The `width`, `height`, and `caption` arguments are all optional.
